Find Recipe
===========

This is a Django/React web app that helps to find recipes based on your fridge/shelf contents.

It is basically the second web app I made, first using React so nothing is perfect, but hey, at least it works as intended.

All the settings, folders etc. are set up for production, hosted on Heroku.
There aren't many commits and changes because the previous work,
of which I'm a bit ashamed, is in a private repo.

You can find the app [here](https://findrecipe.herokuapp.com)
